# TrampolineOS
Bounce back to the past!

TrampolineOS, also known as tOS, is a project to to make older looking operating systems run on modern UEFI devices. This is a one man project so this project will likely take many years such as other one man OS projects, like templeOS. Source code will be released when the full project is finished. No beta versions are meant for daily use, so I reccomend NOT installing TrampolineOS on your main device before the full release. Instead use a vritual machine, as that'll be the only place I'll test the OS in beta stages. Once the operating system is mostly finished, we will start testing on real hardware.
